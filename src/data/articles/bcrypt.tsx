        BCrypt is a password hashing function widely recognized for its ability
        to securely store passwords by generating cryptographic hash values.
        Designed specifically to address the challenges of password security,
        BCrypt incorporates features that make it resistant to brute-force
        attacks, a common method used by attackers to guess passwords. As a
        result, it is a popular choice in modern applications for safeguarding
        user credentials.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The foundation of BCrypt lies in the Blowfish cipher, from which it
        derives its name. What sets BCrypt apart is its use of a built-in
        salting mechanism and an adjustable cost factor. A salt is a unique
        value added to the password before hashing, ensuring that identical
        passwords produce different hash values. This prevents attackers from
        using precomputed hash databases, such as rainbow tables, to crack
        passwords.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        The cost factor, often referred to as the work factor, determines how
        computationally intensive the hashing process is. By increasing the cost
        factor, developers can make the hash generation process slower, which in
        turn makes brute-force attacks more time-consuming and expensive. This
        adaptability is particularly valuable in an era where computing power
        continues to grow, allowing BCrypt to remain effective against evolving
        threats.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        When a password is hashed using BCrypt, the resulting output includes
        three key components: the version identifier, the cost factor, and the
        salt, all embedded within the hash string. This self-contained structure
        ensures that all necessary information for verifying a password is
        included in the hash itself, simplifying implementation and improving
        security.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        BCrypt is commonly used in web applications to protect user passwords.
        When a user creates an account or changes their password, the plaintext
        password is hashed using BCrypt before being stored in the database.
        During login, the entered password is hashed using the same parameters,
        and the resulting hash is compared to the stored hash to verify the
        credentials. This approach ensures that passwords are never stored in
        plaintext, reducing the impact of data breaches.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Another advantage of BCrypt is its resistance to parallelization
        attacks. Unlike many other hashing algorithms, BCrypt is inherently slow
        and memory-intensive, making it difficult to optimize for parallel
        processing. This characteristic provides additional protection against
        attackers leveraging high-performance hardware, such as GPUs or ASICs,
        to accelerate brute-force attempts.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Despite its strengths, BCrypt has limitations. For instance, while it is
        highly effective for password hashing, it is not suitable for
        general-purpose hashing tasks or applications requiring fast hash
        computations. Additionally, the maximum password length for BCrypt is
        typically limited to 72 characters, which may need to be considered in
        applications allowing long passwords or passphrases.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In conclusion, BCrypt is a robust and reliable solution for password
        hashing, offering strong protection against common attacks such as
        brute-force and rainbow table attacks. Its built-in salting mechanism,
        adjustable cost factor, and resistance to parallelization make it a
        preferred choice for developers prioritizing security in their
        applications. By using BCrypt, organizations can better safeguard user
        credentials and enhance the overall security of their systems in an
        ever-evolving threat landscape.

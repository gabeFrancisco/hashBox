      First created back in 1999, Bcrypt hashing is a way to boost the security
      of passwords. It combines the processes of hashing and salting passwords
      to ensure these credentials aren’t saved in plain text. Using the Blowfish
      cipher, Bcrypt is an algorithm that adds random strings of characters to
      passwords. That means Bcrypt hashing adds a level of unpredictability to
      passwords to make these credentials harder to guess. Another element of
      this process is speed. What makes Bcrpyt a preferred choice is that the
      algorithm doesn’t run too fast, helping to protect against a wide range of
      cyberattacks.,
